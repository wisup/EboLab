EboLab
======

A sort of clone of candy crush saga, but using medicines insted of candies.

##Where the idea comes from?
The idea comes from a french TV humoristic show, "Les guignols de l'info". Which gives fake and fun informations.
One day they talked about the scientists in charge of finding the ebola vaccins and they said they didn't found anything, but to gain money, they made an iPhone applciation named EboLab.
For pure fun, I decided to make this application.
My knowledge on making apps is very limited, so I'm starting on a website, then I'll to bring this web app to your phones.

##What I use to help me:
I'm using the source code of 2048 from [gabrielecirulli](https://github.com/gabrielecirulli) which made a really good job and wrote a code really easy to read and modifie.

##What's up?
I'm working on... everything, nothing's done yet, so if you're interested in this project wait for new updates!
